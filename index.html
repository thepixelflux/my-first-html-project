      <h2>Delhi: A Living Mosaic</h2>
      <p>
        Delhi is not just a city — it’s an experience. It brings together people from every corner of the country, each adding their own flavor to its dynamic culture. The city speaks in many languages, wears many traditions, and thrives on its contrasts. Every day in Delhi is a mix of old values and modern rhythms, of quiet resilience and loud celebrations.
        It’s a place where identities blend but voices remain distinct. In its chaos lies a strange sense of order — that’s the spirit of Delhi.
